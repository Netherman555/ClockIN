Hello everyone, I'm Netherman555, sole author of this program.

This program was designed to be a very basic clocking program that was mainly to be used in order to show how much I coded in a day, and
how much my team coded over time.

Currently it's incredibly basic, written in about 2 hours since I'm not very good at C++ yet, and it's also a command line program.  I'm
planning on making it so that it has a basic GUI.

HOW IT WORKS:
This program essentially records the current time of a certain user clocking in and out in a .txt file.  It's as simple as that.  It has 
the date, time, and whether they were clocking in or out, and that's about it.  Like I said, very basic, but useful for small teams.

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
In the short term, I'm planning on using WinForms to make a simple perpetual GUI for the program.  Later on, I plan on making it so that it
can communicate with servers and store the data there, so that teams working from home can also use it without the possibility of incorrect
or fraudulent clocking.

Like the license says, anybody can use this for just about any purpose, I don't really care.  I would prefer if you give credit where
applicable, but if you don't, hey, it's not like I get payed for it, so go ahead and be a little sh*t (just kidding).

Anyway, thanks for taking interest in the project, and please be sure to tell me if it goes wrong.
